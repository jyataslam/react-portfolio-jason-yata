During the creation of their website I was responsible for building the landing, procedures, photos, and before & after patient photos pages, all translated via wireframe. The tech we used included Javascript (ES6), HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Since we needed a place to store thousands of photos, I decided to use Contentful as a headless CMS and was responsible for the set up and input of all patients' photos and content, as well as creating the functions to fetch the data and dynamically create individual pages. After the completion and approval of their new site, I used Amazon Web Services for hosting and integrated a chat service, ApexChat.",
